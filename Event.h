// TO DO: #include all the standard libraries and your own libraries here

// To DO: define the class Event with the necessary functions' prototypes and data fields

// This is a function that allows you to compare two events based on their name. 
// You may directly include it in your class definition. 
// You don't need to modify it but will have to put it inside your class. 
// Operator overloading function prototype:
bool operator==(const Event& otherEvent) const;
